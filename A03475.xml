            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I end this part with this ſentence of Cyrill: <hi>Vbi fides recta et irreprehenſibilis cum honorum operum honeſtate coniungitur, &amp; aquo cur ſu admittitur, illic omninò eſt in omni bono perfectio, &amp; ſanctificationis integritas:</hi> Where a right and vnreprovable faith is conioined with the excellency of good workes, and entertained in one current with them, ther is a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in al goodneſſe, and there flouriſheth the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of ſanctification.</p>
            <p>I haue adioined to this Sermon (wherin I haue diſcourſed at lardge of each point of the Texte pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it) an Apologetical diſcourſe not impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to thoſe thinges, wherunto the application of the ſermon then tended wherein I haue fully and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confuted al ſuch ſlaunders, wherewith our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Country, and Gracious Prince hath beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely
<pb facs="tcp:4341:7"/> and vncharitably charged &amp; traduced by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers malicious adverſaries in the greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſtories of Chriſtendome, for that to the glory of God and honour of Q. Elizabeth the 17. of Nove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated in feſtivall and ioyful manner by the ſubiects of this land in theſe times: our thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God being grounded on the Apoſtles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the 1.<note place="margin">1: Tim: 2:</note> to Timothy and the 2.

Conſt. 1.2.</note> at ſet times, in the honour of their ſoveraignes.</p>
            <p>The motiues that induced mee to vndertake the treatiſe of theſe matters were theſe. Firſt for that this argument fitted the vſe of the doctrine which I ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Paules the 17. of November Anno Domini, 1599. and was a neceſſary conſequent in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Secondly for that by ſundry things expreſſed in the contentes of the Apologie each indifferent Reader may palpably deſcipher the fruites of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous malice, and malitious diſloialty. Laſtly, for that this Apology may ſerue as a Caveat for al good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to beware of al ſeditious ſpirites, who, in ſuch places where they may be bold, and hope to paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without controlement, ceaſe not to ſet abroach ſclaunders of this nature: hoping, by the intoxicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this venoum, to breede in many her Maieſties ſubiects a miſlike of the preſent government, a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe of wel-doing, a loathing of the ſincere and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike religion, which by Gods bleſſing this flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb facs="tcp:4341:7"/> Realme enioyeth in theſe times vnder the peaceable and bright ſunne-ſhine of Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths Regiment.</p>
            <p>And although the Sermon runneth only in the general heades of diſcourſe: yet I thought it moſt expedient to handle the things contained in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology ſcholaſtically, or after the maner of Schools, partly for that the truth or falſhood of things of this quality wil eaſier appeare, and is ſooner brought to head and iſſue by queſtional debatement truely and faithfully collected and alleadged, then by long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing.

            <p>There may be numbred in this Realme at theſe times neere 5000.

The maine ſtreame and tide of Students in Divinity is caried wholie this way, not without ſome ſecret influence of Gods ſpirite, I doubt not: In the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities the greateſt nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ſcholers deſire to haue their names in the regiſter of the ſonnes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: Now of theſe 5000. if there were but 50. able men dedicated to this worke, men qualified in gifts, men which like <hi>Hur</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> would hold vp <hi>Moſes</hi> hands,<note place="margin">Exod. 17.</note> whileſt <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> diſcomfite <hi>Amalecke:</hi> I dare boldly ſpeak, that the ſtudies of theſe 50. faith fully imploied, (ſo that they would not imitate the

                  <p>The firſt place that ſerueth for my purpoſe herevnto, is a Canon of the Apoſtle contained in the 3. firſt verſes of the 2.

                  <p>In the Eccleſiaſticall ſervice perfourmed in the church of England the 7. of September, and the 17. of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at theſe times ſome rites are vſed diſhonourable to GOD, and to the office of the B. Virgin the mother of God.</p>
                  <p>I demaund the adverſaries conviction herein.</p>
                  <p>The evidence herein (ſaith the Accuſer) I demonſtrate in this manner. To the greate contempte of the B. Virgin you make the 7. of September an holiday, which is the Even of the <hi>B, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgines</hi> Nativity. This 7. you ſolemnize moſt devoutly: this day you ſignificantly note in your Calender with red letters, but the day of the Nativity of the <hi>B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgine</hi> you expreſſe onely in blacke Characters &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of the Accuſation implieth thus much (omitting that which is ſpoken of the noting of the 7. of September the day of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Nativity with red lines referring you to mine anſwere herein in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the ſecond generall head.)

Virgine,</hi> then the feaſt of her Nati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vity, namely the <hi>B. Virgine.</hi> Firſt I deny that the church of England celebrateth the 7. of September as an holie day, let the adverſary proue this by practiſe, or preſident Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, or decree Epiſcopall or Archiepiſcopall of the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t church of England, &amp; let me beare the ſhame of it.

<pb facs="tcp:4341:57"/> be herd) That Antiphone or Himne that was accuſtomably in the end of the ſervice ſonge by the Quierin the honor of the bleſſed Virgin, is now converted (as it is reported by common fame) to the laude and honor of Queene Elizabeth, thereby to ſounde her prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwere by negation, denying vtterly that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch forme of Antiphone is vſed in Pawles Church at London, or in any other Cathedral church or chappell of this Realme: Yet will I not deny but that there is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphone ſonge in Paules a little before the concluſion of ſervice both at morne and even the 17. of November, but this Antiphone is meere Euchariſtical, indited only to this purpoſe to giue God thankes for the happy regimente of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> noe waies tending to her commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, further then to glorifie God for her happy and peaceable regiment, vvhich GGD hath lent vs his 41. yeares, which God graunt ſhe may long continew &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in. Moreover obſerue this (Gentle Reader) that this Antiphone is ſonge in the church the 17. of November onely, and at no other time: wherein it is evident that the author and contriver of this accuſation hath either wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and maliciouſly chardged the church of England with an vntruth.
